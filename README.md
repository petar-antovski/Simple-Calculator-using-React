# Simple-Calculator-using-React

In this project I developed a Simple Calculator App using React.

The application conissts of an input field, buttons to perform calculations, an input reset button and a result reset button.

Upon performing a calculation, the result appears above the input field.

Through this project I practiced my new skills in React.
